    Game Headers
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    The headers of a game are information on the game other than its moves and
    board position. Headers supported by Schach are "Event", "Site", "Date",
    "Round", "White", "Black", and "Result". Game headers are loaded with games,
    and you can even edit them mid-game. Go to Edit>Edit Game Headers, and simply
    change any of the headers in the dialog. These changes will be kept when you
    save the game.
