    Status Frames
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    Schach has status frames to either side of the board. They display information
    like current play status (check, etc.), game history, and remaining pieces.
    To go to a move in the move stack, simply double-click on it, and the game
    will automatically be undone up to the move (not including the move). All
    the moves can be redone, as well: go to Edit>Redo All. More on undo and redo
    <a class="link" href="games.html">here.</a>

<p class="text-paragraph1">
    To show/hide the status frames, go to View>Toggle Status Frames.
