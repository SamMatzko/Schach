    Creating a Game
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    Schach by default starts up with a new game. To create a new
    game, go to File>New Game, or hit Control+N.
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    If you want to create a game with a custom start position, go
    to Game>Setup Start Position. A window will pop up with a
    small chessboard in which you can arrange the pieces. You can
    select one of the pieces at the right to put on the board.
    Placing a piece on top of the same piece will remove that
    piece from the board.
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    You can also have the engine setup a position for you. Go to
    Game>Engine Setup Position. The engine will play part of a
    game against itself, and then stop. This will create a new
    game, so you can't set up a positon, and then have the engine
    set up a new position from there.
</p>
<p class="text-header1">
    Playing a Game
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    To move a piece, you click on it, and then click on the square
    that you want to move it to. If the move is legal, it will be
    played. Otherwise, it won't.
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    To have the engine play a move, either click on the play icon
    in the window's titlebar, go to Game>Engine Move, or hit
    Control+E. The engine will play a move, at the playing
    power it is set to (more on engine power 
    <a class="link" href="template.html">here.</a>)
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    To have Schach play a random move, either click on the loop icon in the
    window's titlebar, go to Game>Random Move, or hit Control+R. A random move
    will be played.
