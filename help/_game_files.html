    Saving Games
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    To save a game in DCN format, go to File>Save: Add Game or File>Save: Replace
    Game. The difference is that one replaces the entire file, and the other
    simply adds your game to the end of the file. The current game will be saved.
    NOTE: Be aware that most chess applications do not support DCN. If you want
    your game file to be compatible with other chess applications, export the
    game as a PGN.
