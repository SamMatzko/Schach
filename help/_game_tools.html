    Creating a Game
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    Schach by default starts up with a new game. To create a new
    game, go to File>New Game.
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    If you want to create a game with a custom start position, go
    to Game>Setup Start Position. A window will pop up with a
    small chessboard in which you can arrange the pieces. You can
    select one of the pieces at the right to put on the board.
    Placing a piece on top of the same piece will remove that
    piece from the board.
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    You can also have the engine setup a position for you. Go to
    Game>Engine Setup Position. The engine will play part of a
    game against itself, and then stop. This will create a new
    game, so you can't set up a positon, and then have the engine
    set up a new position from there.

    Copying and Pasting Games
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    To copy a whole game, go to Edit>Copy Game. This will put the entire
    game, including move history, onto the clipboard. If you just want the board
    position, go to Edit>Copy Game Fen.
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    To paste a copied game, including move history, go to Edit>Paste Game. Schach
    will reload the board and game headers, just as it would a normal DCN file.
    To paste a board position, go to Edit>Paste Game Fen. This will just
    rearrange the board to the position in the clipboard.
