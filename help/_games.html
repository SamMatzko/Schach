    Playing a Game
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    To move a piece, you click on it, and then click on the square
    that you want to move it to. If the move is legal, it will be
    played. Otherwise, it won't.
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    To have the engine play a move, either click on the play icon
    in the window's titlebar or go to Game>Engine Move. The engine will play a
    move, at the playing power it is set to (more on engine power 
    <a class="link" href="template.html">here.</a>)
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    To have Schach play a random move, either click on the loop icon in the
    window's titlebar or go to Game>Random Move. A random move will be played.

    Undo and Redo
</p>
<p class="text-paragraph1">
    If you ever need to undo a move (but let's hope it's not to cheat!), go
    to Edit>Undo. The last move made will be undone. To redo the last undone move,
    go to Edit>Redo. To undo all the moves, go to Edit>Undo All, and to redo all
    the moves, go to Edit>Redo All.
