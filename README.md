<h1>Schach</h1>

Schach is a chess app written in Python, that uses Gtk and the powerful Stockfish chess engine. It has full undo-redo functionality, 21 different playing levels for
each side including a random move feature, and help docs that are still in progress. See the Issues tab for all known errors and todos, and please add to that list
if you think something can be improved.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>For Linux</h3>

For now, the install file only works for Linux. If you have a Linux, just unzip the Schach directory wherever you want it, and then run the install file 
(either `install.sh` or `install.py`).
